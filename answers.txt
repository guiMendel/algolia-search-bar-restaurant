"Algolia will search through any set of data, as long as itâ€™s structured. This is what we call an index"
"An index is a collection of records that you create as soon as you send records to Algolia"
  Index -> a structured set of data, that collects records provided by the user
"The items are broken down into individual records (objects), with each object containing a set of fields (attributes)"
"An Algolia record (or object) is a set of key-value pairs called attributes"
  Record -> an entry in the dataset you provide that represents an item, comprised of key-value pairs
